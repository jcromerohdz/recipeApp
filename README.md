## Project specification
The project you are going to build for the React capstone is based on a catalogue of recipes. It is not an app to help you make a recipe because we don't want you to build the prepare and share screens. We just want you to build a catalogue, that is, a browsable list of items that you can filter and access to the details of one item. We provide a sample design that you can follow, but in this capstone project you are not required to follow the design guidelines but use them as an inspiration.

in the fallowing link you can find more about project specification.

## This project use the following tools
- Node.js
- React
- React-DOM
- React-Redux
- Redux
- React-Create-App
- Axios
_ React-Router-Dom
- npm
- Yarn
- CSS
- ES6


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Features
The webapp should have at least 2 types of pages:
- one page with a list of items that could be filtered by some parameters; in the example project, it's a list of recipes that can be filtered by ingredients (shrimp, broccoli, etc.)
- one page for the item details; in this example, the product detail page (Preview Recipe)

While developing the project, you should follow the best practices that you already learned in the previous projects, like setting-up a code linter, using gitflow, testing business logic, writing good commit messages and an informative README. Also, you must strive to use best practices in React & Redux development, like using a nice folder/files structure with good names and separate different types of components and services.
